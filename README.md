## Summary
This project introduces us to Flask and SQLite databases.

## Usage

Just navigate to the root directory of this project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies. Then, initialize the database with `flask --app blog init-db` and run the app with `flask --app pytter run`.

If you have NodeJS installed, you can just run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if using Yarn), followed by `npm run seed` (or `yarn seed`), followed by `npm run start` (or `yarn start`).

## Notes
1) This assumes you have some variant of Python 3 already installed.
